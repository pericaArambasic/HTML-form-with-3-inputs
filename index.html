   <h4>The worst tourist</h4>
   <p>The least successful tourist on record is Mr Nicholas Scotti of San Francisco. In 1977 he flew from
                America to his native Italy to visit relatives.
                En route the plane made a one-hour fuel stop at Kennedy Airport. Thinking that he had arrived, Mr Scotti
                got out and spent two days in New York believing he was in Rome.
                When his nephews were not there to meet him, Mr Scotti assumed they had been delayed in the heavy Roman
                traffic mentioned in their letters. While tracking down their address, the great traveller could not
                help noticing that modernization had brushed aside most, if not all, of the ancient city’s landmarks.
                He also noticed that many people spoke English with a distinct American accent. However, he just assumed
                that Americans got everywhere. Furthermore, he assumed it was for their benefit that so many street
                signs were written in English.
                Mr Scotti spoke very little English himself and next asked a policeman (in Italian) the way to the bus
                depot. As chance would have it, the policeman came from Naples and replied fluently in the same tongue.
                After twelve hours travelling round on a bus, the driver handed him over to a second policeman. There
                followed a brief argument in which Mr Scotti expressed amazement at the Rome police force employing
                someone who did not speak his own language.
                Scotti’s brilliance is seen in the fact that even when told he was in New York, he refused to believe
                it.
                To get him on a plane back to San Francisco, he was raced to the airport in a police car with sirens
                screaming. ‘See,’ said Scotti to his interpreter, ‘I know I’m in Italy. That’s how they drive.’</p>
